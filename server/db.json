Choose fresh—not pre-frozen—salmon, which has clear, slightly translucent flesh with a bit of a sheen. Steer clear of fish that is dull or dry with brown edges, or which smells fishy. The color of salmon varies from species to species, so deep color is not always an indicator of quality."

Wet fish won't crisp or hold seasoning, so it's very important to dry well. Cut the filet into three- to four-ounce portions and season with salt and pepper.     "
